# Algorithms Unplugged — Code Implementation

## 📘 Project Description

This repository is created for the **code implementation of the book _Algorithms Unplugged_**.  
It aims to transform the book’s theoretical concepts into clear, practical C++ programs.

The repository is organized to follow the same structure as the book,  
making it easy to navigate, understand, and experiment with each algorithm.

---

## 🧩 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into **4 main parts**, each corresponding to a section of the book.  
Every part contains its related **chapters (ch1, ch2, ch3, ...)** in order.

Part1/
 ├── ch1/
 ├── ch2/
 ├── ch3/
 ...
Part2/
 ├── ch11/
 ├── ch12/
 ...
Part3/
 ├── ch21/
 ├── ch22/
 ...
Part4/
 ├── ch31/
 ├── ch32/
 ...

Inside each **Part**:
- Each chapter folder includes its **C++ code implementation** for the discussed topic.  
- Each part also contains a **summary.md** file summarizing all chapters in that part.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Provide practical and organized C++ implementations of algorithms from *Algorithms Unplugged*.  
- Bridge the gap between theory and practice for learners and enthusiasts.  
- Serve as an educational reference for algorithmic thinking and data structures.

## ⚙️ Build & Run

To compile and run a specific chapter example (e.g., `ch1/main.cpp`):

```bash
g++ src/ch1/main.cpp -o build/ch1.out
./build/ch1.out
